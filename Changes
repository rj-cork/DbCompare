DataCompare.pm 

	1.22
		- fixes in connect string parsing - password can contain special characters now, service name can contain - and .
		- GetColumns and GetPrimaryKey weren't processing tables with '$'

	1.21
		- db connection strings will be always printed not only in debug mode

	1.20
		- PrintMsg printing to STDERR didn't flush properly when duplicated with end of a pipe

	1.19
		- DataCompare()	is passing argument whether add "[$TABLENAME.$PARTITION] " prefix to every output line

	1.18
		- if there are PK/UK columns only in the table and we are about to check SHA1 then switch to keycompare more
		 because SHA1 is calculated using columns not in PK/UK. Flag SWITCH_TO_CMP_PK_IF_NEEDED turn this on.
		- add "FirstStageWorker: sql execution finished across all workers." message when all workers finish sql execution
		 and start retrieving data
		- total out of sync records calculation error in FirstStageWorker for more than 2 databases/connections
	
	1.17  
		- add flag for skipping comparison of column type and column nullable flag --nochecktype --nochecknullable

	1.16	 
		- add compare by PK/UK only - not by given column nor sha1 sum

	1.15  
		- add exclude columns

	1.14  
		- check if number of columns is the same in compared tables

	1.13  
		- support for XMLType for SHA1: XMLType.getBlobVal(CONTNT_XML_TXT,nls_charset_id('AL32UTF8')) but it could
		 be better with XMLType.getClobVal(CONTNT_XML_TXT) or t.CONTNT_XML_TXT.getClobVal() from data_owner.table t

	1.12  
		- turn off limiter in case comparing using column, 
		 do we really need to add some lag in where clause for GG? you cannot compare other types than date/tmstmp then

	1.11  
		- if error and die, print $RUNNING code 

	1.10  
		- sleep for each secondstage fixed

	1.09  
		- parameter file changed to logfile

	1.08  
		- GetPrimaryKey  do not force the same constraint name

	1.07  
		- DataCompare.pm

	1.06  
		- add comments

	1.05  
		- add mappartition and manual

	1.04  
		- add partition and partitionfor

	1.03  
		- change to_clob to utl_raw.cast_to_raw gives better performance on non lob column

	1.02
